# PyBer Challenge

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to summarize how the ride-sharing data differs by city type, and how those differences can be used for decision-making at Pyber. We'll do this by going over the following data: Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and Driver, and Total Fare by City Type. 

## Results

The below chart will be used to discuss the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types being Rural, Suburban, and Urban.

### Total Rides
There are far more rides in Urban cities as opposed to Rural and Suburban which is consistent with differences in population. The demand in rides in more populated cities is going to be much higher than in Suburban towns, or more remote areas. Therere about 1,000 more rides in Urban cities versus Surburban cities, and when comparing Rural and Urban city types, Total Rural Rides is a fraction of Total Urban Rides.
### Total Drivers
The Total Drivers data is consistent with Total Rides, as there are far more drivers in Urban cities versus the other two city types. This can be contributed to supply and demand. However, there are far more drivers then total rides in Urban cities, and less total drivers than rides in Rural and Suburban cities showing that drivers are in higher demand in Rural and Surburban cities and of less demand in Urban cities. 
### Total Fares
Total Fares is also consistent with the above results, since there are more rides in Urban cities there will be a much higher number in Total Fares at $39,854. Vice versa, since Rural cities have the least amount of total rides, the Total Fare is going to be the lowest out of the 3 types of cities at $4,328. 
### Average Fare per Ride and Drivers
When observing this data we can see that the Average Fare per Ride and the Average Fare per Driver is much higher in Rural Cities, compared to the other two. Suburban would be in the middle, and Urban at the bottom with the lowest Average Fare per Ride and the Average Fare per Driver. Since Rural areas tend to be less populated and have a lower supply of drivers, the fare ride would be pricier along with the fare per driver as there are less drivers, less demand, and ride-sharing services aren't as accessible. In comparison, in Urban settings there are other methods of transportation, ride-sharing services are easily accessible, and there are far more drivers that are disposable. This would make the Average Fare per Ride in Urban cities lower (by $10 compared to Rural cities, and $5 compared to Suburban cities), and in turn the Average Fare per Driver significantly lower (by $38 compared to Rural cities, and $23 compared to Suburban cities) as the supply of drivers is very high compared to  the demand of rides. 
### Total Fare by City Type
The below chart and data shows the Total Fare by City Type from the months January 2019 through April 2019. This is all consistent with the Total Fares discussed above in that, there will be a higher number of Total Fares in Urban cities, Suburban would follow, and Rural would have the least Total Fares. Although the Average Fare per Ride and Drivers is higher in Rural Cities, there are far more total rides in Urban cities which results in the overall number significantly higher in Urban cities.

## Summary

Overall, the data is consistent with what most would assume which is the higher the population, the higher the total rides, total drivers, and total fares will be in comparison to places of smaller populations like Urban and Suburban cities. And since there are more drivers in Urban cities, the lower the average fare per ride and drivers will be as it's a more easily accessible service.

### Recommendations
Going over the data, there are far more drivers in Urban cities than there are rides. One recommendation could be to limit the number of drivers to a fewer amount. This could assist in possibly increading the average fare ride and the average fare per driver which would be beneficial to Pyber and the individual drivers. Going off of that, it may be worthwhile to look into seasonality, if there are more total rides in certain seasons compared to others it can be an indication to hire more drivers for that season, and stop hiring during less active seasons. 

### Disparities Among City Types
When comparing Rural and Urban cities there are huge disparities. The Total Fares and Average Fare per Drivers are the biggest ones. Urban cities are bound to be higher in Total Fare as they have significantly higher total rides, even considering that the Average Fare per Ride is higher in Rural cities. Average Fare per Drivers is also a big one as drivers in Rural cities are averaging at $38 more than drivers in Urban cities. But there is a lot more competition in Urban cities amongst drivers versus in Rural cities where there are more rides than total drivers.
